# Contribution guidelines

Ongoing development on this project is managed by this project board: https://github.com/neontribe/www/projects/6.

## Getting started on development

Any issues in the `Top priority issues` column are important enough and have been prioritised.

When contributing to this project please do the following:

1. Pick something near the top of the `Top priority issues` column, which you feel you have the time and confidence to tackle.
   - We expect you to learn while tackling issues, please don't be put off by a tasks' seeming complexity.
1. Check the [Definition of done](#definition-of-done) for the ticket to see if you understand it.
   - If you need more information please follow up with the person who spawned/created the task.
1. Assign yourself and move the ticket to the `In progress` column.
1. Create a branch with a name to help match it to the ticket, e.g.: `307-contrib-docs`. _n.b._ [avoid slashes in branch names](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2527355/using-the-slash-character-in-git-branch-name/2527452#2527452)
1. Work on the feature branch, make small commits which include the _reason_ for each commit's change.
   - We don't expect you to battle the problem alone, put any queries on the github issue and slack, people will help when they have time.
1. When you're happy with the changeset/the commits you've made, and you're happy that the ticket passes its [Definition of done](#definition-of-done) create a pull request.
   _n.b._ Pull requests are the pull requester's responsibility, when it receives the request number
1. Await code review, see [Review proces](#review-process)

Please make sure that you keep your activity up-to-date:

1. take each ticket as far as you can, before taking another one (e.g. ready for code review)
   - if the ticket needs to be put on hold because you've reached the limit of your availability or understanding then;
     - put you findings/thoughts on the ticket
     - put the branch name (if any) on the ticket
     - unassign yourself and put it back in `Top priority issues`

WIP:

## Getting tickets ready to be worked on

- weekly meeting to discuss open tickets
- tickets should be left in the backlog or closed if vetoed
- anyone can create issues
- creating an issue involves writing up a compelling argument for a feature, perhaps pictures. Adding a definition of done is important, doesn't have to be acceptance criteria

## Review process

Two or more peers need to approve the commit, when reviewing check the code for errors and check that it achieves the definition of done for the ticket

## Testing

is done using feature branch deploys on pull request

## Definition of done

Acceptance criteria etc.
