  Help for young people visiting their GP with mental health issues
client: |
  Docready
problem: |
  Comic Relief’s 2012 Innovation Labs brought the voice of young people right into the design of services for them to use. Neontribe were one of a consortium who facilitated the labs. Eight of the ideas that came out of that process were selected for funding. One was Docready, which we were chosen to develop. 8 years later, it’s still helping hundreds of people every week.
solution: |
  - Empowered users to remember what they wanted to say to their GP, and how they wanted to say it. 
  - Developed, tested and iterated a digital service with young people.
  - Balanced user needs for security and functionality with an eye to keeping maintenance very low cost.
  - Built a tool to last with technologies that wouldn’t go out of date.
  - Collaborated with 3 organisations to deliver the project.
