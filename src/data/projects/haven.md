  Developing a small storytelling app to help persuade women to seek help
  
problem: |
  Abusive behaviour in a relationship can be hard to recognise. Women experiencing abuse often are unaware that support is available. Online support tools can be jargon laden and lack relatable examples.
  
solution: |
* Designed safe, inclusive user research activities that women felt helped them as well as helping us
* Listened to women who had been through this journey to understand the fears and barriers they wanted us to focus on
* Collaborated with frontline workers and volunteers to collect women’s stories.
* Shared with the women the version we wanted to put online to help others
* Built an award winning app that combines women’s stories with illustrations and encourages people to call a helpline
* Helped convert elements of the app to social media and poster based advertising
