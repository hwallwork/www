  Online training and mentoring for charities getting started with user-led design
client: |
  Catalyst Discovery Programme
problem: |
  More and more charities are turning to digital projects to help them make a difference.  They need skills and confidence to help them make clear decisions about technology.  Training, mentoring and peer learning have to fit around very busy day jobs. This project needed to support charities of different sizes. They also had varied knowledge and different projects to complete.
solution: |
  - Re-used existing training materials and designed new ones.
  - Combined group training activities with individual mentoring.
  - Helped people understand how to deliver user research that is fair, safe and meaningful.
  - Passed on skills in service design that charities decided to use across their work, not only for digital projects.
  - Supported people to understand how to choose a new piece of software or technology.
