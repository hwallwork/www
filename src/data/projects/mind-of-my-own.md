  Helping more than 450 services across the UK hear young people’s voices

  Developing apps for Mind of my Own
problem: |
  Young people weren’t keen on filling in endless paper forms, and they had no way of keeping track of what they had said and whether social workers listened.
solution: |
  We began by experimenting with how to help young people get their voices heard,
  and now Mind of My Own has a suite of digital tools they sell to councils.
  We build and maintain the apps that let young people say important things in different ways.
  Our expertise helps Mind of My Own meet ISO27001 and GDPR standards so councils and young people trust the system.
