  Improving online information that explains safeguarding responsibilities to small organisations
problem: |
  The project aimed to provide clear, simple safeguarding advice for small charities. It focused on supporting organisations that only work with young people or adults at risk from time to time.  Existing information could be hard to find and confusing.
  
solution: |
* Led a UK wide user research programme, exploring how people searched and how they reacted to what they found.
* Produced a content style guide for use by all partners.
* Helped NCVO plan a structure for a core set of information pages.
* Content designed and edited step by step plans with safeguarding subject specialists.
* Collaborated on evaluation for the funders: DCMS and the National Lottery Community Fund.
* Took learning from this project into 2 more content design projects with NCVO.
