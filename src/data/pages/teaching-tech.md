# Teaching Tech

## Want to get better at helping developers learn? Join our accredited course to improve your teaching skills

We get training to support our learning, so why don’t we get training to support our teaching? When developers understand how to teach, everyone wins. It gets easier to deliver work and teams become more resilient.

The skills you’ll learn on this course will help you and your team get the most out of knowledge sharing. We'll set you up to overcome frustrations by using techniques from experienced educators who work in tech.

## What is it?

This is an intensive course that takes place over three full consecutive days. It is about practical learning. On the last day you will get the opportunity to deliver your own fifteen minute ‘micro teach’.

## What will the course cover?

Course modules have been selected to be the most appropriate for those working in tech and include:

- Creating a safe and supportive learning experience
- Incorporating inclusive teaching approaches into your planning and delivery
- Understanding principles of one-to-one learning and development
- Assessing progress and giving constructive feedback

## Why Neontribe?

**Trainers who have been in your shoes.** Our trainers are all developers or people who work alongside development teams on a day to day basis. Over the last ten years we’ve been experimenting with how to best share our knowledge within our teams. This programme is an opportunity for us to pass on some of that learning.

**Trainers who are qualified and experienced teachers.** Some of our trainers have teaching qualifications from before they became developers, others bring coaching experience from varied disciplines - rugby, music and theatre.

**A reputation for training.** Neontribe team members deliver training to the local tech community as well as to students at Norwich University of the Arts and the University of East Anglia. We have developed coaching and mentoring activities with our clients, bringing skills into the charity sector in the UK. We run internships, coding courses and work experience programmes. Several of our current employees first came to the company through one of these schemes.
