After becoming an accidental chef, I had the opportunity to leave the catering industry. I have been writing code since I was 14, building game cheats in VB6 and plugins for Counter Strike Source. Since then I've been working with a variety of languages to build accessible applications. I enjoy the challenge of keeping up with new tech and immersing myself into the culture. I have enjoyed supporting less experienced colleagues and leading a range of projects to architect and build interfaces of all sorts, whether that be application to application interfaces or web and voice interfaces.
