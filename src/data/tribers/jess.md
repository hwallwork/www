As a member of the Exeter office, I work fairly closely with my office colleagues, but my friends up in Norwich aren't safe from my questions and fun facts! I know a lot of trivia which one might argue is "useless", to which I say "hah!" ...and "yeah, it probably is." Champion code-wrangler and general Guardian of the (Programmer's) Realm, I swear allegiance to the Holy Bugfix.
