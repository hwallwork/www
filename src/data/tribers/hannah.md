I’m Hannah, the user research intern and the newest member of the tribe! I did a BA in Illustration which taught me storytelling and accessibility. After working an in-house design role, I knew I wanted to work on meaningful design. This led me to Neontribe to learn how to make decisions based on the user’s needs! When I’m not learning new things you’ll find me reading, running or watching cheesy supernatural tv shows.
