I completed my bachelor degree in computer science from India and then started a job as SEO executive for a few years and then I got interested in front-end development. I worked as a front-end developer for 1.5 years and then took a long break (Maternity). Now I want to start once again with my career in front-end development but I was so confused where to start with as there are so many things in to the market now (vue, react, sass, git etc). Then Neontribe gave me a chance to start again within my field. At Neontribe I will work as a 'Front-end dev intern'.
