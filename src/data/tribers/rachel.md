On the cusp of beginning a PhD in Psychology, I realised I needed to problem solve in a more visually creative way. Through a couple of intense years dedicating myself to the creative process, I found my passion working in design.
At Neontribe, I enjoy the challenge of designing for function and communication, whilst maintaining an artistic look and feel in my work. I deeply care about working on projects for good and hope that I am helping people in a small but meaningful way. Outside of work I can be found climbing, drawing or exploring nature.
